# Merge Sort Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Overview
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively breaks down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems until they become simple enough to solve directly. The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to solve the original problem.

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n) - We need an auxiliary array to store the merged subarrays

## Key Features
- Stable sorting algorithm
- Guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity
- Efficient for large datasets
- Used as a building block in many other algorithms
